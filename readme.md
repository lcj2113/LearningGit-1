This is a project for practicing git.

# What is Git?
Git is a version control software, that keeps track of our software/code, it maintains the history and changes of our project. We can also have numerous versions of our code simultaneously.

# Initializing a Git repository
Starting our git repo, to begin maintaining our project's version history.

# Git Commit
A commit is a checkpoint that represents and holds our code at that point in our project's history. We can always revert back to a previous commit to undo any changes. Usually used to store a significant change in our project.

# Git and Github
Keep in mind that git and github are TWO different things. git is a version control software that can be used on your conputer, certain text editors/ides and it's what github uses behind the scenes to maintain your code. Github is a remote service that holds your git repos.
